Cooking Recipe
--------------

**Cabbage and Mushroom Lasagna**
--------------------------------

### *Ingredient*:

-   unsalted butter
-   flour
-   lowfat milk
-   salt and pepper
-   ground nutmeg
-   onion
-   gralic
-   mushroom
-   Napa cabbage
-   potato
-   white wine
-   Parmesan cheese

### *Kitchen tools*:

-   sauté pan
-   heat oven
-   bowl
-   table spoon
-   9-by-9-inch baking dish or a lasagna pan

### *Reipe*:

1.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.
2.  In a large sauté pan over medium heat, melt 6 tablespoons of the butter. Add flour, stir for 3 minutes (do not allow to brown), then gradually whisk in milk, stirring until thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in nutmeg and season with salt and pepper to taste. Scrape sauce into a bowl, and reserve.
3.  While the mushroom and cabbage mixture is simmering, pour 6 cups of water into a stock pot, and bring to a boil. Add whole cabbage leaves, and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain under cold water, and pat dry on towels.
4.  Grease a 9-by-9-inch baking dish or a lasagna pan of your choice (I used this, which is 8-by-12-inch) with remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.
5.  To assemble the lasagna, line the bottom of the dish with half the cabbage leaves, and top with half the potatoes, half the creamed mushrooms. Repeat the layering of cabbage, potatoes and mushrooms, and top with grated cheese. Cover snugly with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover, and bake until the top is golden brown and potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes but up to 10 minutes longer if needed. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, and serve.

### *Special season of the year*:

-   The recipe comes from the Marcus Jernmark, the Swedish chef who, at the time, helmed Aquavit, a high-end Scandinavian restaurant in midtown.Jernmark explained that in the fall in Sweden, they eat cabbage, kale, and mushrooms, and he wanted to turn them into a seasonal, especially for winter, homey take on lasagna.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

**Definition**
--------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

*d*(**p**,**q**) = *d*(**q**, **q**) = $\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_2)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+...+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$
= $\\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$.
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and \***q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

||**P**|| = $\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+...+p\_n^2}$= $\\sqrt{P\\cdot P }$,
where the last expression involves the dot product.

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.
