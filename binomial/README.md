Overview
--------

`"binomial"` is an R package that provides functions to calculate the probability of binomial random variable. And the package also provides functions to calculte other related property of binomial random variable.

-   `bin_choose()` calculates the number of combinations in which `"k"` success can occur in `"n"` trials

-   `bin_probability()` caculates the binomial probability of `"k"` success in `"n"` trials given `"p"` probability

-   `bin_distribution()` list the probabality of each successe with probability `"p"` in `"n"` trials
